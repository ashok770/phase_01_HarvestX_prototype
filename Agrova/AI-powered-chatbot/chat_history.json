        "bot": "Namaste!\n\nTo recommend the right pesticide, I need a bit more information. When you say you \"cropped the rice 1 week ago,\" are you looking to protect the rice stubble for a ratoon crop, or are you concerned about pests affecting the land before your next planting cycle? Pesticides are typically applied during the growing season or for stored produce protection.",

        "bot": "Not necessarily. Even one week after transplanting or direct seeding, young rice plants can be susceptible to early-stage insect pests like stem borers or defoliators. It's crucial to regularly monitor your field for any signs of pest infestation rather than assuming no protection is needed. Applying pesticides should be based on identifying specific pests and if their population reaches damaging levels.",

This can significantly impact your yield if not managed properly.\n\nTo help you, could you tell me more about what you're observing? For example:\n*   What kind of insects are you seeing? (e.g., small green bugs, caterpillars, moths)\n*   What specific parts of the plant are being damaged? (e.g., leaves chewed, stems cut, sap sucked)\n*   How old are your rice plants now?",

Both are significant agricultural pests that can damage crops.\n\nYes, they are damaging. Aphids suck sap from new growth and buds, weakening the plant. Two-spotted leafhoppers feed on the underside of leaves, causing yellowing and reducing overall plant health.",
